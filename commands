Navigation:
ctrl+ alt+t : This opens the terminal on my PC.
Up arrow : To tranverse through the history to use previously used commands.
pwd : Prints working directory.
ls : Lists what we have in the current location.
ls [-l] [path] : It is used for long listing the current location or the path provided.
Absolute path starts with front slash "/", whereas, relative path doesn't.
"~" : This is the shortcut for the home directory. In my case for /home/Akash/
"." : This refers to the current directory.
".." : This is used for the parent directory. It can be used several times to go up the heiraacy. ef "../../"
cd <path> : to move to a directory. Not providing path takes to the home directory.
Use tab for autocomplete. If there are mutiple options, nothing happens. Press twice to see all options.

Files:
file [path] : This is used to determine what kind of a file a perticular file is.
Note: Linux is a case sensitive language.
Avoid spaces in file names. If used, to access a file, write the name is single or double quotes.
We can also use backslash "\" to nullify the meaning of special characters.
Auto completion using tab space automatically nullifies the space.
To make a file hidden, start it's name with a full stop.
ls does not show hidden files. So use the optional command -a. eg, ls -a Documents

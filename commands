Use tab for autocomplete. If there are mutiple options, nothing happens. Press twice to see all options.

Files:
file [path] : This is used to determine what kind of a file a perticular file is.
Note: Linux is a case sensitive language.
Avoid spaces in file names. If used, to access a file, write the name is single or double quotes.
We can also use backslash "\" to nullify the meaning of special characters.
Auto completion using tab space automatically nullifies the space.
To make a file hidden, start it's name with a full stop.
ls does not show hidden files. So use the optional command -a. eg, ls -a Documents

Manual Pages:
man <command to look up> : This is used to open the manual for any command.
man -k <search term> : To search a keyword in the manual.
To search in a manual page, put a slash before the term.

mkdir [options] <directory> : It is used to make a directory.
-p as an option creates parent directory as required.
-v as an option tells whatever it is doing.
rmdir [options] <directory> : It is used to remove the directory.
Note: rmdir removes only empty directory in this way.
touch [options] <filename> : To create a blank file.
cp [options] <source> <destination> : It is used to copy a file.
